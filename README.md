Individual Age at Peak Velocity Based on SITAR


This package provides three methods for computing individual age at peak velocity (apv), peak velocity (pv) and height
(or weight) at peak velocity (ypv) based on the SITAR model proposed by Cole et al. (2010).
The first is the numerical method; the second applies the property of the quadratic function to calculate apv; 
and the third is derived from the assumption of the SITAR model. In order to obtain the apv, pv, 
and ypv of each individual accurately, it is necessary to interpolate age measurements for original data.
