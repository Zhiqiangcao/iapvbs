Description: This package provides three methods for computing individual age at peak velocity (apv), 
             peak velocity (pv) and height (or weight) at peak velocity (ypv) based on the SITAR model 
             proposed by Cole et al. (2010). The first is the numerical method; the second applies the 
             property of the quadratic function to calculate apv; and the third is derived from the 
             assumption of the SITAR model. In order to obtain the apv, pv, and ypv of each individual 
             accurately, it is necessary to interpolate age measurements for original data.
